          <p>In this day and age, you've more than likely watched several videos on the internet in your lifetime.  Many of these videos probably had different levels of quality, with some of them loading faster, but having worse resolution, and others not even working with certain web browsers.  That's because not every video has the same file format. It turns out there is an ever increasing variety of video file types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  In fact there's so many video file types out there on the Internet, that this website won't be covering all of them.  Instead, this site will be focusing on some of the most commonly used video format types, why they're used, and what sets them apart from one another, as well as when to use certain video file formats. </p>
